\lettersection{About Me}
I am currently working remotely for Cerner, a global healthcare IT company, designing and developing a Ruby on Rails REST API platform that handles hundreds of millions of requests per week for hospitals and clinics worldwide aggregated across multiple geographical and logical zones. Since joining Cerner, I have been identified as a strong and solid presence on my team. I am a vocal member, actively taking part in team discussions, design sessions, and suggesting areas for improvement with colleagues across various technical backgrounds. I have always been an independent learner and am always eager to learn about the code I am working on rather than just trying to make the change. Perhaps most importantly, I do not merely suggest improvements but follow through on them.

One of my more notable accomplishments includes leading in the design, development, and testing of our new API rate limiting service. This project alleviated pressure from the underlying services on our platform that were inundated with an unreasonable amount of requests from clients misusing/abusing our platform. After the service was integrated into our platform, we managed to reduce our 503 (Service Unavailable) responses to near zero percent. This project was considered so successful that I was commended by my team lead, project manager, and director.

I look forward to hearing more about this oppurinity and to demonstrate my unique skillset. More details can be found in my attached CV. Thank you for your time and consideration.

% strong opinions, weakly held

% thinking about problems is like gum; it gives me something to chew on throughout the day.

% I have also been entrusted with developing critical features on my own for hard deadlines like ones imposed by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) which included addressing all CVEs before deploying to production. I managed to address all the CVEs in our Docker image by migrating to distroless containers which eliminated all CVEs unrelated to the application itself or its runtime dependencies. After that, it was just a matter of updating our runtime dependencies and making small adjustments to our codebase to account for the other CVEs.

% Outside of the typical design and development, I have also worked on improving our CI/CD process and documentation. One particularly impactful change allowed contributors to deploy their own fork of our platform with their API changes, independent from the live instances in our development and staging environment. Our previous process for contributors required us to merge their changes to a single branch and deploy that branch as our live instance every time any contributor needed to update their API. With 40 APIs hosted on our platform and growing, this was unscalable. However, by using a Jenkins job and changing some load balancer configurations, I was able to easily create a workflow for our contributors to test their APIs in our development and staging environment without having to rely on us to deploy their changes.

% had many opportunites to grow due to short staffing on team

% \lettersection{Why GitHub?}
% There's a pride you feel when working on software that you _and_ your fellow developers use. I feel like this is especially true for GitHub. For a tool/platform to be so popular and widely used within one of the fastest - if not _the_ fastest - moving industries, it really demonstrates just how effective GitHub can be as a company and as a platform. GitHub would be a great fit for me in particular because I am seeking more autonomy in my career, and GitHub is willing to do that by encouraging independence and individual responsibility among its developers. As a long time independent learner, I expect this additional autonomy will help me grow into an even more effective software engineer.

% faster development / less impediments to development

% \lettersection{Why Me?}
