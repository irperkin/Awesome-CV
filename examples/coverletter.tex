\lettersection{About Me}
I am currently working remotely for Cerner, a global healthcare IT company, designing and developing a Ruby on Rails REST API platform that handles hundreds of millions of requests per week for hospitals and clinics worldwide aggregated across multiple geographical and logical zones. Since joining Cerner, I have been identified as a strong and solid presence on my team. I am a vocal member, actively taking part in team discussions, design sessions, and suggesting areas for improvement with colleagues from various technical backgrounds. I have always been an independent learner and am always eager to learn about the code I am working on rather than just trying to make the change. Perhaps most importantly, I do not merely suggest improvements but follow through on them.

One of my more notable accomplishments includes leading in the design, development, and testing of our new API rate limiting service. This project alleviated pressure from the underlying services on our platform that were inundated with an unreasonable amount of requests from clients misusing/abusing our platform. After the service was integrated into our platform, we managed to reduce our 503 (Service Unavailable) responses to near zero percent. This project was considered so successful that I was commended by my team lead, project manager, and director.

I look forward to hearing more about this position and demonstrating my unique skillset. Thank you for your time and consideration.
